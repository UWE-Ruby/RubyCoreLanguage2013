  # method should take one parameter, an array of integers.
  #   ok to assume items are integers.
  # the method should return an array of integers.
  #   but it should ignore the even items.
  # method is an iterator, like #each, that goes through each item
  #   in the array passed in.
  # block can be the second parameter, or implicit.
  # you can use the #even? method you just wrote!
  it '#each_odd iterates an array and yields the odd values to the block'
